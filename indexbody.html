    <h2>Introduction to Computer Systems</h2>
    <p>
      A computer system is a combination of hardware and software that work together to process data and perform tasks. At its core, a computer system includes the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices, and input/output peripherals. The CPU is responsible for executing instructions, while memory temporarily stores data that the CPU needs to access quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computer's storage devices, such as hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs), store data permanently. These devices allow users to save files and software applications. Input devices like keyboards, mice, and scanners enable users to interact with the system, while output devices like monitors and printers display or present the processed data.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Components</h2>
    <p>
      The fundamental components of a computer system are crucial for its functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The brain of the computer that executes instructions and manages operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> Temporary storage that provides quick access to data needed by the CPU.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage Devices:</strong> Hard drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD) that store data permanently.</li>
      <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> Devices such as keyboards and mice that allow users to input data into the system.</li>
      <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> Devices such as monitors and printers that present the results of the processed data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The operating system (OS) is essential software that manages the computerâ€™s resources, allowing users and software to interact with the hardware. It controls the execution of programs, manages files, and ensures communication between the hardware components.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding the basic components of a computer system helps users interact more effectively with their machines. Whether you are using a computer for work, entertainment, or learning, knowledge of its internal structure provides a better appreciation of its capabilities.
