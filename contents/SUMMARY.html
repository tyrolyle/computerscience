          <li><strong>Introduction and Its History:</strong> This section likely provides
            a brief overview of computers and how they have evolved over time.</li>
          <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</strong> The CPU, often referred
            to as the "brain" of the computer, is responsible for processing instructions
            and data. It's the central component that executes all the commands you
            give your computer.</li>
          <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> The motherboard acts as the foundation of
            your computer system. It connects all the other hardware components, including
            the CPU, RAM, storage drives, and expansion cards. It also houses the chipset,
            which manages data flow between the different components.</li>
          <li><strong>Main Memory (RAM):</strong> Also known as Random Access Memory,
            RAM is a temporary storage space that holds data currently being used by
            the CPU. It allows the CPU to quickly access frequently used data for faster
            processing. RAM is volatile, meaning data is lost when the computer is
            turned off.</li>
          <li><strong>Secondary Memory:</strong> Secondary storage, often referred to
            as storage devices, holds data permanently. Unlike RAM, data persists even
            after the computer is powered off. Common secondary storage devices include:
            <ul>
              <li>Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): Traditional storage devices that use magnetic
                platters to store data. They are relatively inexpensive but slower than
                newer options.</li>
              <li>Solid-state Drives (SSDs): Use flash memory to store data and offer significantly
                faster read/write speeds compared to HDDs. They are becoming increasingly
                popular but tend to be more expensive per gigabyte.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Graphics Card (GPU):</strong> A specialized processor designed
            to handle graphics processing tasks. It's essential for tasks that require
            intensive visual rendering, such as gaming, video editing, and graphic
            design. The GPU can significantly improve the performance of these tasks
            compared to relying solely on the CPU for graphics processing.</li>
          <li><strong>Input/Output Devices (I/O Devices):</strong> These devices allow
            you to interact with your computer and exchange information. They can be
            categorized into two main groups:
            <ul>
              <li>Input Devices: These devices send data or control signals to your computer.
                Examples include keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, scanner, webcam, microphone,
                game pad/joystick, and sensors.</li>
              <li>Output Devices: These devices receive data from the computer and present
                it in a human-understandable format. Examples include monitor, printer,
                speakers, projector, and headphones.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Expansion Slots:</strong> Motherboards provide expansion slots
            like PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) that allow you to
            add functionality to your PC with expansion cards. Examples include graphics
            cards, network cards, sound cards, and storage controllers for NVMe SSDs.</li>
        </ul>
