        <h3><strong>COMPUTER</strong>:</h3>
        <h4>&nbsp;A Computer is a electronic device used to process data and produce it processed as output. In early days, before the invention of electronic computers, people who did computations where known as computer.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>HISTORY OF COMPUTERS:</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:40px;">By seeing about the computer history it was a fascinating history from
          mechanical calculator to the computer what we use today.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:40px;">Let us move by timeline:</p>
        <h4 style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>Early Calculating Devices (17th-19th Century): (analog)</strong></h4>
        <p style="margin-left:40px;">In early days, <i><strong>ABACUS</strong></i> is used to do arithmetic operations,
          it is said to be the beginning of the calculating devices.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:40px;">Later on <i><strong>SLIDE RULE</strong></i>- a type of mechanical analog
          computer used in the calculation of multiplication and division &nbsp;</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:40px;">In 1822 and 1833, <i><strong>DIFFERENCE ENGINE</strong></i> and <i><strong>ANALYTICAL ENGINE</strong></i> designed
          by <u>CHARLES BABBAGE</u>, these two are mechanical calculators which is
          said to be the precursors of the modern day computer. It was not full developed
          but laid foundation for further development.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>The Birth of Electronic Computers (1940 s-1950 s): (electronic)</strong></h4>
          <p style="margin-left:40px;"><i><strong>ENIAC (1945):</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong> The Electronic
            Numerical Integrator And Computer. &nbsp;first general purpose electronic
            computer. Built during world war two. It used vacuum tubes. so that they
            can change position much faster than mechanical one. It could add 5,000
            numbers in just one second, an astounding feat for the time. It took up
            an entire room and contained 18,000 vacuum tubes. Programming the ENIAC
            was much different than what software developers do today; this early work
            consisted of cables being plugged into plug boards.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:40px;"><i><strong>UNIVAC I (1951): </strong></i>The Universal Automatic Computer
            I (UNIVAC I) was the first commercial computer available to the public.
            It was used for various purposes, including business record-keeping and
            scientific calculations.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>The Transistor Revolution and Beyond (1950 s-Present):</strong></h4>
          <p style="margin-left:40px;"><i><strong>Transistors</strong></i>: The invention of the transistor in
            the 1950 s revolutionized computers. Transistors are much smaller, faster,
            and more reliable than vacuum tubes, leading to the development of smaller,
            more efficient computers. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors could be
            much smaller and used less power. &nbsp;Transistors were developed at Bell
            Labs in New Jersey. William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain
            worked to create the transistor.The EDVAC was designed as an improvement
            of the ENIAC and could use stored programs to function.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:40px;"><i><strong>Integrated Circuits (ICs): </strong></i>In the 1960 s, the
            invention of integrated circuits (ICs), also known as microchips, further
            miniaturized computers. ICs contain millions of transistors on a single
            chip, making it possible to build even more powerful computers in smaller
            packages.Creating and discovering computer technologies has progressed
            rapidly since the days of the vacuum tube, but the field of computing would
            not be where it is today without this important invention. Building on
            the transistor, the integrated circuit was born, and today, this technology
            is found in numerous devices, from desktop computers to video game consoles.
            But science is never content to rest on its laurels; new discoveries are
            always being made in an effort to create better and more efficient electronics.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:40px;"><i><strong>Personal Computers (PCs): </strong></i>The 1970 s and 1980
            s saw the rise of personal computers (PCs), making computing accessible
            to individuals and businesses. The invention of the graphical user interface
            (GUI) in the 1980 s made computers easier to use for non-technical users.</p>
