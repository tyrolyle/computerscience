      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In the world of computers, input/output (I/O) devices are the hardware
          components that allow you to interact with your machine and exchange information.
          They act as the bridge between you and the digital world, enabling you
          to provide instructions and receive results. Here's a breakdown of the
          different categories of I/O devices:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>1. Input Devices:</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">These devices allow you to send data or control signals to your computer.
          They are the tools you use to communicate with your system and tell it
          what to do. Common input devices include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> The most fundamental input device, allowing
            you to enter text, numbers, and symbols by pressing keys.</li>
          <li><strong>Mouse:</strong> A pointing device used to control the on-screen
            cursor and interact with graphical user interfaces (GUI s).</li>
          <li><strong>Touchscreen:</strong> A display screen that detects your touch,
            allowing for direct manipulation of on-screen elements on devices like
            tablets and laptops.</li>
          <li><strong>Scanner:</strong> Captures physical documents or images and converts
            them into digital files.</li>
          <li><strong>Webcam:</strong> A video camera that captures live images or videos,
            often used for video conferencing or streaming.</li>
          <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Records audio input, enabling voice commands,
            recording sound, or video conferencing.</li>
          <li><strong>Gamepad/Joystick:</strong> Controllers specifically designed for
            gaming, providing buttons and joysticks for precise control in video games.</li>
          <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> These can be built-in (like motion sensors in
            laptops) or external (like webcams), detecting physical phenomena like
            movement, light, or temperature, and converting it into digital data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>2. Output Devices:</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">These devices receive data from the computer and present it in a human-understandable
          format. They are the tools that display the results of your actions or
          the information the computer generates. Common output devices include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> The primary visual display device, showcasing
            computer-generated images, text, and videos.</li>
          <li><strong>Printer:</strong> Creates physical copies of digital documents
            or images on paper or other media.</li>
          <li><strong>Speakers:</strong> Produce sound output, allowing you to listen
            to music, movies, games, or system sounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Projector:</strong> Displays an enlarged image from a computer
            onto a screen or surface, ideal for presentations or sharing information
            with a larger audience.</li>
          <li><strong>Headphones:</strong> Personal audio devices that provide private
            listening of audio output.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Key Points to Remember:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A single device can sometimes function as both input and output. For instance,
            a touchscreen can be used for input (selecting options) and output (displaying
            visuals).</li>
          <li>The specific I/O devices you use will depend on your computer's purpose
            and your personal needs. A gamer might prioritize a high-performance mouse
            and graphics card, while a graphic designer might need a high-resolution
            monitor and a pressure-sensitive drawing tablet (another input device).</li>
          <li>Wireless connectivity (Bluetooth, WiFi) is becoming increasingly common
            for I/O devices, eliminating the need for cables.</li>
        </ul>
