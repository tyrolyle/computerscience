        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>What is a graphics processing unit (GPU)?</strong></h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a computer chip that renders graphics
          and images by performing rapid mathematical calculations. GPU's are used
          for both professional and personal computing. Originally, GPU's were responsible
          for the rendering of 2D and 3D images, animations and video, but now they
          have a wider use range.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The graphics card, also known as a video card, display card, graphics
          adapter, or VGA card (Video Graphics Adapter), is a crucial component for
          any computer that deals with visuals. It acts as the muscle behind generating
          images on your screen, playing a vital role in everything from displaying
          your desktop wallpaper to running demanding games and video editing software.</p>
        <h2
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>What does a GPU do?</strong>
          </h2>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">In the early days of computing, the CPU performed the calculations required
            for graphics applications, such as the rendering of 2D and 3D images, animations
            and video. As more <u>graphics-intensive applications</u> were developed,
            however, their demands put a strain on the CPU and decreased the computer's
            overall performance.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">GPU's were developed as a way to offload those tasks from CPU's for graphics
            applications. A GPU performs graphics-related calculations very quickly
            and in parallel to allow for fast and smooth rendering of content on the
            computer screen. Since the GPU takes care of the calculations, the CPU
            is free to handle everything else that's not related to the graphics application.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;">example:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">A GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, acts like a <strong>specialized co-pilot</strong> for
              your computer's central processing unit (CPU) when it comes to handling
              visuals. Here's how it works:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>The CPU's workload:</strong> Imagine your CPU is the main manager
              in your office (computer), overseeing all tasks. While it can handle many
              things, displaying graphics can be quite demanding, like processing tons
              of calculations for complex images.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>The GPU steps in:</strong> The GPU is like a highly skilled assistant
              dedicated to graphics. It takes over the heavy lifting of visual tasks
              from the CPU, freeing it up to focus on other things. This allows for smoother
              overall performance, especially in applications that rely heavily on graphics.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Components of a Graphics Card:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>GPU:</strong> The heart of the graphics card, responsible for the
                  heavy lifting of graphics processing.</li>

                  require additional power connectors to provide sufficient electricity for
                  operation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Here's what the GPU excels at:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Mathematical muscle:</strong> GPU's are built for performing a
                  massive amount of calculations simultaneously. This is crucial for tasks
                  like:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rendering images:</strong> Breaking down complex images into smaller
                      parts and calculating how to display them on your screen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manipulating textures:</strong> Applying textures (like the details
                      on a brick wall) to 3D objects to make them appear realistic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Applying lighting effects:</strong> Simulating how light interacts
                      with objects in a scene, creating realistic shadows and reflections.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Separate memory for faster processing:</strong> GPU's have their
                own dedicated memory called VRAM (Video RAM). This allows them to quickly
                access the data they need for graphics processing without having to rely
                on the main system memory (RAM). Think of it like the GPU having its own
                workspace with readily available tools (data) for handling visual tasks
                efficiently.</p>
              <p><strong>How does GPU works:</strong>
                <br>The GPU is designed to excel at these intensive graphical computations.

              <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Transfer:</strong> The CPU sends graphical instructions and
                  data (like 3D models, textures) to the GPU's memory (VRAM).</li>
                <li><strong>Vertex Processing:</strong> The GPU processes the 3D models (vertices)
                  to determine their position and transformation on the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Rasterization:</strong> The 3D models are converted into 2D pixels
                  that can be displayed on your monitor.</li>
                <li><strong>Fragment Processing:</strong> Each pixel's color, lighting, and
                  texture information are calculated and applied.</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> The final image data is sent to the display through
                  the graphics card's output ports (HDMI, Display Port).</li>
              </ol>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Types of Graphics Cards:</strong>
