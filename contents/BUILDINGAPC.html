      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Preparation:</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Gather your parts:</strong> Ensure you have all the necessary components.
          This typically includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</li>
          <li>Motherboard (compatible with your CPU)</li>
          <li>Memory (RAM) - compatible with your motherboard (check speed and type)</li>
          <li>Storage (HDD, SSD, or a combination)</li>
          <li>Graphics Card (optional, but recommended for gaming or graphics-intensive
            tasks)</li>
          <li>Power Supply Unit (PSU) - with enough wattage to handle your components</li>
          <li>Computer Case (with good airflow)</li>
          <li>Thermal Paste (to conduct heat between CPU and cooler)</li>
          <li>Screwdrivers (Phillips head and flathead)</li>
          <li>Zip ties (optional, for cable management)</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Choose a clean, well-lit workspace:</strong> Make sure you have
          enough space to comfortably lay out all your components.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Building Process:</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Prepare the case:</strong> Remove the side panel of the case for
          easy access to the interior. Depending on the case, you might need to remove
          some drive bays or other components to make space.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Install the CPU:</strong> Carefully locate the CPU socket on the
          motherboard and gently place the CPU in the socket, ensuring proper alignment
          with the pins. Secure the CPU lever or latch to hold it firmly in place.
          (Refer to your motherboard manual for specific instructions)</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Apply thermal paste:</strong> Apply a pea-sized amount of thermal
          paste to the center of the CPU (check your CPU cooler's instructions for
          specific application methods).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Install the CPU cooler:</strong> Depending on the cooler type,
          you might need to secure it to the motherboard using the provided mounting
          bracket and screws. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper installation.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Install the RAM:</strong> Locate the RAM slots on the motherboard.
          These slots will have latches on either side. Carefully push the RAM sticks
          straight down into the slots until the latches click into place, ensuring
          they are securely seated. (Consult your motherboard manual for the correct
          RAM slots to use for optimal performance)</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Install the storage drives:</strong> Most cases have designated
            bays for mounting storage drives (HDDs and SSDs). Secure the drives using
            screws or by pushing them into caddies that snap into place. (Refer to
            your case manual for specific drive bay locations and installation methods)</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Install the graphics card (if applicable):</strong> Locate the
            PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) slot on your motherboard
            (usually the longest slot). Carefully remove the PCIe slot covers at the
            back of the case and secure the graphics card into the slot. Tighten the
            retaining screw to hold it in place.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Install the Power Supply Unit (PSU):</strong> Mount the PSU in
              the designated location at the back of the case. Secure it with screws
              and connect the necessary power cables to your motherboard, CPU, storage
              drives, and any other components. (PSU cables might have different connectors,
              so double-check to ensure they are plugged into the correct ports on your
              components)</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Connect the front panel connectors:</strong> Locate the small headers
              on your motherboard for the front panel functions (power button, LED lights,
              USB ports, etc.) Consult your motherboard manual to identify the correct
              connectors and carefully plug in the corresponding cables from your case's
              front panel.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Organize cables:</strong> Use zip ties (optional) or the built-in
              cable management features of your case to neatly organize excess cables.
              This will improve airflow within the case and create a cleaner look.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Double-check connections:</strong> Before turning on your PC, take
              a moment to verify that all components are securely seated, cables are
              properly connected, and no loose screws are present.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Finishing Touches:</strong>
              </p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Close the case:</strong> Reattach the side panel of the case.</p>
              <p
              style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Connect peripherals:</strong> Connect your monitor, keyboard, mouse,
                and any other external devices to the corresponding ports on the back of
                your PC.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Power on!:</strong> Plug your PC into a power outlet and press
                  the power button. If everything is assembled correctly, your PC should
                  boot up.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Install the operating system:</strong> You'll need a bootable USB
                  drive with your chosen operating system (e.g., Windows 11) to install it
                  on your new PC. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation
                  process.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Install drivers:</strong> Once the OS is installed, update your
                  device drivers for optimal performance. These drivers can typically be
                  downloaded from the manufacturer's website for your motherboard, graphics
                  card, and other components.</p>
