Introduction to Computer Science Hardware Basics

Welcome to the Computer Science Hardware Basics discussion thread! This space is dedicated to discussing the foundational concepts related to the hardware side of computer science. If you're new to computer science and want to learn more about the physical components that make up computers and other digital systems, this is the place for you.

We’ll focus on topics like:

    Computer Architecture: The design and organization of computer systems, including CPUs, memory hierarchy, buses, and more.
    Digital Logic: Understanding gates, flip-flops, and how they form the basis of computation.
    Microprocessors: The heart of any computer—how processors work, CPU cycles, and architecture types (x86, ARM, etc.).
    Memory: Types of memory (RAM, ROM, Cache, Virtual Memory) and how they interact with processors.
    Storage Devices: Hard drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and storage hierarchies.
    Input/Output Systems: How computers communicate with peripherals (keyboards, displays, sensors).
    Networking Hardware: Routers, switches, network interface cards (NICs), and how data moves between systems.
    Power Supply & Efficiency: How hardware components are powered and the importance of energy efficiency in modern computing.
    GPU/Parallel Computing: The role of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in high-performance computing tasks.
